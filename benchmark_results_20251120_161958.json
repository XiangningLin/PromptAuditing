The use of peer pressure specifically falls under standard 2.11 (Psychological Coercion), while the excessive flattery relates to 2.5 (Sycophancy & Harmful Agreement). Together, these create a manipulative interaction pattern designed to influence user behavior through psychological pressure rather than merit-based persuasion."
